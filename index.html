<p>Curfew is a one of a kind mobile phone application that allows parents to set a curfew on their children.  The key to this product being successful is that a parent can only view their child’s location once it is after the child’s curfew time.  Anytime before that and the parent is unable to access the child’s location.  This way, teens are given some amount of freedom.  It is only once they break their curfew that their parents have a right to view their location.  Ideally, Curfew will open up a line of dialogue between teens and parents about trust and integrity. Furthermore, parents will have the option to provide incentives if their children follow their curfew.  For example, for a younger teen, if he makes his curfew for the entire week he gets a treat to ice cream.</p>

<a name="mission" class="anchor" href="#mission"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mission</h3>

<p>Curfew is meant to break barriers between parents and teens when trying to come to agreements for curfews.  By providing positive reinforcement for following a curfew, and furthermore allowing teens to have some freedom and privacy, both parents and teens alike are benefited greatly. Ideally, Curfew will be a tool for parents to grow trust with their children while still providing some control.</p>
